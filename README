This project contains source that was coded live at 
Codemash during the Mobile Smackdown. 

All source is as it was at the end of the session with a single character 
exception: a 1 letter typo was pointed out at the very end of the presentation 
that fixed the keyword search.

Working features:
1. Download Codemash XML feed.
2. Asynchronous download of feed.
3. Cache XML string as shared preference.
4. View sessions in list.
5. Tap to view session details.
6. Type on list to filter by keyword.

Incomplete features:
7. Mark (and persist flag) interesting sessions.
8. View scheduling conflicts among marked sessions.
